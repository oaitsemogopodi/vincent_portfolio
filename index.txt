About me

I am a computer engineer and UI/UX Designer from Botswana, Gaborone, working as a software developer. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created web designs and Phone applications.
